This repository contains code for a Temperature Converter website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website facilitates temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

The HTML file (index.html) forms the structure of the temperature converter web page.
CSS styling (index.css) is applied to enhance the visual presentation and layout.
JavaScript functionality (index.js) handles the temperature conversion logic and interactions.
The temperature converter allows users to input values in one temperature scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and instantly view the converted values in the other two scales.

Contributions, improvements, or suggestions for enhancing the website are welcome
